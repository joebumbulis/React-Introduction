# Day 31: TIY FEE
## Introduction to React

(View the Project Live Here)[http://joebum-day-31-react.intro.surge.sh/]

## Explorer Mode

Using a fresh clone of the webpack-starter, do the following
* Create the UI for a single page blogging application using multiple react components.
* The page should have 5 blog posts already on it, made with static data. Like we did in codepen today.
* There should be a top level App component.
* There should be a component that represents a single blog post or article.
* The data to render the post's body, title, and publish data should be props that are passed in
* There should be a component that represents a 'new post' form on the page.
* There should be an input for title, and a text area for body.
* Each post component should be able to be collapsed via a button in the component using local state.
* Style the site.

### Notes

Completing this assignment will require looking at the react docs and cheatsheets, think about what each requirement is and what question you can come up with based on that.

### What to Submit

* A link to a repository with your code
* In the Notes section, include a link to your project live on the internet
* As always, in the Notes section, include your confidence (1-5) and if you are anything below 5, briefly explain why.

### Adventurer Mode

The form should have validations baked in. As you type the UI should tell you that your title is too short if its less than 4 characters and if its too long if its longer than 200 characters.
The body doesn't have a validation as it can be empty.
Use Backendless or Tiny-za to store your data on the internet and interact with it asynchronously.
Use Backbone Collection and Models instead of raw data and ajax requests

### Epic Mode

Create a navigation component that lets you go to multiple pages on the site.
